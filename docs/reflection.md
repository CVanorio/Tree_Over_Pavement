##Project Reflections

This project highlighted both the potential and the limitations of using high-resolution imagery and deep learning to detect subtle, spatially defined features like tree canopy over pavement. One of the major successes of this project was the development of a fully automated label-generation workflow to create the dataset that combined buffered OSM paved features with canopy height data. This approach eliminated the need for manual image labeling, which is typically the most time-consuming step in urban land-cover mapping, and allowed for consistent labels to be generated across the study area. The pipeline is also reproducible and scalable, and could be extended to additional cities with relatively minor adjustments. Building this workflow also reinforced how much GIS preprocessing is required before a deep learning model can meaningfully attempt a segmentation task.

The modeling results highlighted challenges of this research question. The 6-band teacher model, which had access to explicit pavement and canopy information, obviously performed very well and established a clear upper bound on performance. In contrast, the NAIP-only models had a much harder time. When pavement is fully obscured by tree canopy, the spectral signal contains little to no information about what lies underneath, forcing the models to rely on indirect spatial cues such as canopy shape, proximity to visible roads, and surrounding land patterns.

The NAIP-only student model trained with teacher supervision slightly outperformed the NAIP-only baseline across most metrics, indicating that the teacher’s predictions do help transfer some spatial reasoning about the target class. That said, both NAIP-only UNets showed a clear tendency to over-label tree canopy in general, often expanding predicted tree regions and struggling to cleanly separate tree-over-pavement from tree-not-over-pavement. These results reflect the imbalance of the labels, where tree pixels dominate, and the TOP class is extremely sparse.

These results also highlight a key limitation of the labeling strategy itself. Although the labels are generated programmatically, they depend heavily on OSM completeness and canopy height accuracy. Small misalignments or missing pavement features introduce noise that propagates directly into model training. Combined with class imbalance and mixed pixels, this makes precise identification of TOP especially difficult using RGB and NIR alone. Future work could benefit from improved pavement masks, better handling of class imbalances, or the inclusion of additional data sources such as LiDAR or SAR.

Overall, this project succeeded in building a scalable and reproducible pipeline and demonstrated that a NAIP-only model can learn parts of the tree-over-pavement pattern, especially with knowledge distillation. At the same time, it clarified the practical limits of what can be inferred from RGB/NIR imagery alone and points us in the direction of the types of data and modeling strategies that would be needed to meaningfully improve performance for this segmentation task.
